## üìÅ Architecture Overview

ROAP uses a microservices architecture, allowing independent scaling and modular functionality. Services communicate via Kafka for real-time updates, Redis for caching, and PostgreSQL for persistent data.

### Microservices

1. **User Service**: Manages user profiles and authentication.
2. **Order Service**: Handles order creation, updates, and retrieval.
3. **Inventory Service**: Manages product stock and inventory.
4. **Payment Service**: Processes payments and updates order statuses.
5. **Analytics Service**: Consumes events for reporting and analysis.
6. **Notification Service**: Sends notifications for significant events.
